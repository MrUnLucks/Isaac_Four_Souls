# Isaac Four Souls WebSocket Server

A Rust WebSocket server implementation for Isaac Four Souls game, built as a progressive learning exercise.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── main.rs              # Main application entry point with async main
├── player.rs            # Player struct with UUID-based IDs
├── player_manager.rs    # PlayerManager for handling collections of players
├── messages.rs          # Game message enums (ServerMessage, ServerResponse)
├── traits.rs           # Messageable trait definition
└── async_utils.rs      # Async utility functions for network simulation
```

## Dependencies (Cargo.toml)

```toml
[dependencies]
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

## Completed Exercises

### ✅ Exercise 1: Basic Rust Setup and Ownership

- Created `Player` struct with UUID-based IDs
- Implemented methods: `new()`, `disconnect()`, `Display` trait
- **Key Learning**: Structs, methods, ownership, borrowing

### ✅ Exercise 2: Collections and Error Handling

- Created `PlayerManager` with `HashMap<String, Player>`
- Implemented methods: `add_player()`, `get_player()`, `remove_player()`, `list_connected_players()`, `disconnect_player()`
- **Key Learning**: HashMap, Option, Result, error handling, ownership transfer

### ✅ Exercise 3: Enums and Pattern Matching

- Created `ServerMessage` enum: `Join`, `Leave`, `Chat`, `Ping`
- Created `ServerResponse` enum: `Welcome`, `PlayerJoined`, `PlayerLeft`, `ChatMessage`, `Pong`, `Error`
- Implemented `handle_message()` function with comprehensive pattern matching
- **Key Learning**: Enums, pattern matching, comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Exercise 4: Traits and Generics

- Created `Messageable` trait with `send_message()` and `get_id()` methods
- Implemented trait for `Player`
- Created generic `broadcast_to_all()` function
- **Key Learning**: Traits, generics, trait bounds

### ✅ Exercise 5: Basic Async Programming

- Converted main to async with `#[tokio::main]`
- Implemented `simulate_network_delay()` with tokio sleep
- Implemented `handle_multiple_requests()` with concurrent task spawning
- **Key Learning**: Async/await, tokio runtime, spawning tasks, concurrent execution

## Current Status

**Currently On**: Exercise 6 (TCP Server Basics)
**Next Step**: Create a basic TCP server using `tokio::net::TcpListener`

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **UUID-based Player IDs**: Using `String` UUIDs instead of `u32` for better uniqueness and real-world applicability
2. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns into different modules for better organization
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Using `Result` and `Option` types throughout for safe error handling
4. **Ownership-First Design**: PlayerManager owns players, external code interacts through manager methods

## Code Quality Achievements

- ✅ Proper Rust ownership and borrowing patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (no unwrap() in production paths)
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Good use of Rust idioms (derive macros, pattern matching)
- ✅ Async-ready architecture

## Remaining Exercises

6. **TCP Server Basics** - Basic TCP networking with tokio
7. **JSON Serialization** - Integration with serde for message serialization
8. **WebSocket Server - Basic** - First WebSocket implementation
9. **WebSocket with Message Types** - Integration of game messages with WebSocket
10. **Multi-Client WebSocket Server** - Concurrent connection handling
11. **Connection Management** - Proper lifecycle and cleanup
12. **Advanced Features** - Rooms, authentication, reconnection

## Notes for Next Session

- All exercises build incrementally on previous work
- Code is well-organized and ready for TCP server implementation
- Focus on learning Rust concepts while building practical WebSocket server
- Each exercise includes specific learning objectives and builds toward Isaac Four Souls game backend

## How to Continue

1. Review current code structure
2. Run `cargo run` to test current functionality
3. Proceed with Exercise 6: implement TCP server using `tokio::net::TcpListener`
4. Each exercise includes clear learning focus and builds on previous concepts

_This project serves as both a practical WebSocket server for Isaac Four Souls and a comprehensive Rust learning journey covering ownership, async programming, networking, and real-world application architecture._
